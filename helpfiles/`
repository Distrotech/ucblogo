` list							(library procedure)

	outputs a list equal to its input but with certain substitutions.
	If a member of the input list is the word "," (comma) then the
	following member should be an instructionlist that produces an
	output when run.  That output value replaces the comma and the
	instructionlist.  If a member of the input list is the word ",@"
	(comma atsign) then the following member should be an instructionlist
	that outputs a list when run.  The members of that list replace the
	,@ and the instructionlist.  Example:

		show `[foo baz ,[bf [a b c]] garply ,@[bf [a b c]]]

	will print

		[foo baz [b c] garply b c]
