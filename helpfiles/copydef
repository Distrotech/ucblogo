COPYDEF newname oldname

	command.  Makes "newname" a procedure identical to "oldname".
	The latter may be a primitive.  If "newname" was already defined,
	its previous definition is lost.  If "newname" was already a
	primitive, the redefinition is not permitted unless the variable
	REDEFP has the value TRUE.  Definitions created by COPYDEF are
	not saved by SAVE; primitives are never saved, and user-defined
	procedures created by COPYDEF are buried.  (You are likely to be
	confused if you PO or POT a procedure defined with COPYDEF because
	its title line will contain the old name.  This is why it's buried.)

	Note: dialects of Logo differ as to the order of inputs to COPYDEF.
	This dialect uses "MAKE order," not "NAME order."
